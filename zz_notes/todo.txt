stream handler

connected ansi code processor; however how does clear() work?
    somehow adjusting the pageStep does not work in _create_control; too small; fixed by adjusting scrolling


clear clears by one line too much?
does not auto scroll when lines go below window

need to encapsulate "control" to be used in view, allowing all signals to be processed properly
    context menus, event filter and signals depend on whether it is read only or not

first fix context menus

clear_output
and other handlers
